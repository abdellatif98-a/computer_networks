## 2 Key Network-Layer Functions

- Forwarding
  - Local (moving a packet from a router's input to an appropriate output port, i.e. inside one router)
- Routing
  - Global (moving packets from one source to another destination over multiple different routers and hops)
- Routing Algorithm used to create the forwarding table in each router

## Virtual Circuit & Datagram Networks

- Virtual Circuit & Datagram Networks are network-layer connection and connectionless services, parallel transport-layer connection-oriented and connectionless services
- The implementations of connection-oriented service in the transport layer and the connection service in the network layer are different:
  - The transport-layer connection-oriented service is implemented at the edge of the network in the end system
  - while the network-layer connection service is implemented in the routers in the network core as well as in the end systems.

- Virtual Circuits (_e.g._ ATM)
  - Call Setup/Teardown
  - VC Identifier
  - Router State
  - Resource Reservation
  - Forwading table in Virtual Circuit mode:
    - ![vc mode](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/vc%20mode.png?raw=true)
- Datagram Network (_e.g._ IP)
  - No Call Setup
  - No State Info in Routers
  - Packets Forwarded using Destination Address
  - Forwarding Table (longest prefix matching):

- Datagram vs. VC Network:
  - Designed for Computers vs. Designed for Telephones
  - Smart End Systems vs. Dumb End Systems
  - Simple Core vs. Complex Core
  - Many Link Types vs. Few Link Types

- IP Fragmentation & Reassembly
  - MTU (1500 bytes normally)
  - Fragmentation
    - ![fragmentation](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/fragmentation.png?raw=true)
  - Reassembly

## IP Addressing

- IP Addresses
  - ![IP Addr](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/IP%20addr.png?raw=true)
- Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0 mask same as /24 notation above)
  - ![subnet mask](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/subnet%20mask.png?raw=true)
  - ![subnets](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/subnets.png?raw=true)
- CIDR
- DHCP protocal for dynamically obtaoin IP Address
  - Discover/Offer/Request/ACK Messages
  - ![DHCP protocal](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/DHCP%20protocal.png?raw=true)
- Hierarchical Addressing
  - ![hierarchical addressing](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/hierarchical%20addressing.png?raw=true)
- Running out of IP Addresses
  - NAT
    - Use 1 Global IP per LAN
    - Use port as additional info
    - ![NAT](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/NAT.png?raw=true)
    - Controversial:
      - Crosses Layers (port number)
      - Violates End-to-End Principle
      - Short-Sighted "Solution"
  - IPv6
    - Streamlined Header
      - 40 Bytes
      - Fixed
      - No Fragmentation
    - Flows and Priority
    - No Checksum
    - Options
    - ICMPv6

## ICMP

- Network-Level Signaling
- Slightly Above IP
- ICMP message
  - Type
  - Code
  - 8 bytes Datagram
- Traceroute and ICMP
  - Source sends series of UDP segments to dest
    - When nth datagram arrives to nth router:
      - ICMP message TTL Expired packet (type 11, code 0)
    - Source computes RTT
  - Stopping Criteria
    - Successful Arrival
    - Host Unreachable
      - ICMP "host unreachable" packet (type 3, code 3)

## Routing algorithms

- Link state
  - Complete Topology, Global
  - Messages: More (Broadcast)
  - Message Size: Smaller (Link Costs)
  - Convergence Speed: Faster
  - Robustness: Better
  - Summary: "Tell the world about their neighbours"
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Distance Vector
  - Local Topology
  - Iterative, Asynchronous, Distributed/Decentralised
  - Messages: Less (Exchange)
  - Message Size: Larger (DVs)
  - Convergence Speed: Slower
  - Robustness: Worse
  - Summary: "Tell neighbours about the world" (i.e. send DV to neighbours)
  - Bellman-Ford Equation
  - Disadvantages:
    - "Bad News Travels Slow"
    - Poisoned Reverse
- Hierarchical routing (the real world's network)
  - Gateway Router
  - Autonoumous Systems (AS)
  - Intra-AS Routing
  - Inter-AS Routing

## Routing in the Internet

- Intra-AS Routing (Interior Gateway Protocols, i.e. IGP)
  - RIP
    - Distance Vector Algorithm
    - Distance Metric:
      - number of hops
      - max = 15 hops
    - Link Failure & Recovery:
      - No Advertisement in 180 sec = You're Dead
      - Update Routes
  - OSPF
    - Publicly Available
    - Link State Algorithm
    - Advertisements

- Inter-AS Routing
  - BGP
    - Prefix + Attributes = Route
    - Import Policy
