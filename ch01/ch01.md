## What is the Internet?
- Network of networks
- packet switch:
  - routers
  - link-layer switches
## The Network Core
- Circuit Switching
  - FDM
  - TDM
- Packet Switching
  - Advantages:
    - No Bandwidth Division
    - No Dedicated Allocation
    - No Reservation
  - Disadvantages:
    - Resource Contention
    - Congestion
    - Store and Forward
## Internet Structure
- connecting each access ISP to each other directly doesn't scale: O(N^2) connections. So instead, we use global transit ISPs. But since those global ISPs have competition too, we use **IXP** and **peering link** to link those global ISPs together.

## Protocal Layers and Their Service Models
- Analogy of Airline Functionality
- Internet Protocal Stack:
  - Application:
    - _e.g._ HTTP, SMTP, FTP
    - about supporting and implementing network applications
    - End-to-End
    - User Services:
      - Web, Email, File Tranfer etc.
    - a packet in this level called a _message_
  - Transport:
    - _e.g._ TCP, UDP
    - getting data from a process program on one host to a program or process on a different host
    - End-to-End
    - Hides Defects and Limitations of the Network
    - ![Transport layer](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/Transport%20Layer.png?raw=true)
    - a packet in this level called a _segment_
  - Network:
    - _e.g._ IP
    - routing datagrams from source to destination
    - Point-to-Point
    - Functions:
      - Addressing
      - Routing
      - _Congestion Control_ (may not provide)
      - _Administration_ (may not provide)
    - a packet in this level called a _datagram_
  - Link:
    - _e.g._ Ethernet, Wi-Fi
    - data transfer between neighboring network elements (how to get from A to B with only one link between them)
    - Point-to-Point
    - Functions:
      - Data Link Layer:
        - Framing
        - Error Control
        - Flow Control
      - Medium Access Control (i.e. Mac) Layer:
        - Sharing the Channel
    - a packet in this level called a _frame_
  - Physical:
    - about how we put bits in a signal and get it across either a wire or the air
    - Point-to-Point
    - Transmission of Raw Bits
    - Functions:
      - Electrical Specs
      - Mechanical Specs
- OSI Reference Model:
- ![OSI Reference MOdel](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/OSI%20reference%20model.png?raw=true)
- Types of Communication Entities:
  - End-to-End (E2E)
  - Point-to-Point (P2P)
