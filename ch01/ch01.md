## How is data transferred through the net?
- Circuit Switching
  - FDM
  - TDM
- Packet Switching
  - Advantages:
    - No Bandwidth Division
    - No Dedicated Allocation
    - No Reservation
  - Disadvantages:
    - Resource Contention
    - Congestion
    - Store and Forward
## Internet Structure
- connecting each access ISP to each other directly doesn't scale: O(N^2) connections. So instead, we use global transit ISPs. But since those global ISPs have competition too, we use **IXP** and **peering link** to link those global ISPs together.
