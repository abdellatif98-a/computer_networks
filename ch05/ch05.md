# The Link Layer: Links, Access Networks, and LANs

---

## Link Layer Services

- Framing, Link Access
- Reliable Delivery
  - (Why both link-level and tranport-level reliability?) if a frame is dropped in the last link, then it'd be costly for the Transport Layer to do that job.
- Flow Control
- Error Detection
- Error Correction
- Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex

- Where is the link layer implemented?
  - Hardware
    - primarily in NIC (network interface card, an adapter, such as Ethernet/wireless card)
  - Software, Firmware

## Error Detection and Correction

- Parity Checking
  - Single Bit Parity
  - Two Dimensional Bit Parity
- Internet Checksum (also is what TCP/UDP/UP use)
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (_i.e._ CRC)
  - Modulo-2 Arithmetic
  - Computationally intensive, so _the transport layer_ might need pay a lot to apply CRC checking, so it uses checksum instead. However, _the link layer_ can take advantage of the hardware

## Multiple Access Control Protocols

- To solve:

  - Single Shared Broadcast Channel
  - Collision

- MAC Protocols Taxonomy:

  - Channel Partitioning:
    - TDMA
    - FDMA
    - CDMA
  - Random Access:
    - ALOHA
      - Maximum efficiency: 1/2e = .18
    - Slotted ALOHA
      - Transmit in Next Slot
      - If No Collision, send new frame in next slot
      - If Collision, retransmit frame in each subsequent slot with probability p until success
      - Maximum efficiency: 1/e = .37
    - CSMA
      - Listen before transmit
    - CSMA/CD
      - both start talking at the same time, we both stop and let one of the other go
      - ![CSMA/CD Collisions](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/CDMA:CD%20collisions.png?raw=true)
    - CSMA/CA
  - "Taking Turns":
    - Polling
      - Concerns:
        - Neec Master Node
        - Polling Overhead
        - Latency
        - Single Point of Failure
    - Token Ring
      - Concerns:
        - Token Overhead
        - Latency
        - Single Point of Failure
  - Comparisons:
    - Channel Partitioning MAC Protocols
      - Efficient and Fair at High Load
      - Inefficient at Low Load
    - Random access MAC Protocols
      - Efficient at Low Load
      - Inefficient at High Load
    - "Taking Turns" Protocols
      - Best of Both Worlds
