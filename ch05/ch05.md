# The Link Layer: Links, Access Networks, and LANs

---

## Link Layer Services

- Framing, Link Access
- Reliable Delivery
  - (Why both link-level and tranport-level reliability?) if a frame is dropped in the last link, then it'd be costly for the Transport Layer to do that job.
- Flow Control
- Error Detection
- Error Correction
- Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex

- Where is the link layer implemented?
  - Hardware
    - primarily in NIC (network interface card, an adapter, such as Ethernet/wireless card)
  - Software, Firmware

## Error Detection and Correction

- Parity Checking
  - Single Bit Parity
  - Two Dimensional Bit Parity
- Internet Checksum (also is what TCP/UDP/UP use)
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (_i.e._ CRC)
  - Modulo-2 Arithmetic
  - Computationally intensive, so _the transport layer_ might need pay a lot to apply CRC checking, so it uses checksum instead. However, _the link layer_ can take advantage of the hardware

## Multiple Access Control Protocols

- To solve:

  - Single Shared Broadcast Channel
  - Collision

- MAC Protocols Taxonomy:

  - Channel Partitioning:
    - TDMA
    - FDMA
    - CDMA
  - Random Access:
    - ALOHA
      - Maximum efficiency: 1/2e = .18
    - Slotted ALOHA
      - Transmit in Next Slot
      - If No Collision, send new frame in next slot
      - If Collision, retransmit frame in each subsequent slot with probability p until success
      - Maximum efficiency: 1/e = .37
    - CSMA
      - Listen before transmit
    - CSMA/CD
      - both start talking at the same time, we both stop and let one of the other go
      - ![CSMA/CD Collisions](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/CDMA:CD%20collisions.png?raw=true)
    - CSMA/CA
  - "Taking Turns":
    - Polling
      - Concerns:
        - Neec Master Node
        - Polling Overhead
        - Latency
        - Single Point of Failure
    - Token Ring
      - Concerns:
        - Token Overhead
        - Latency
        - Single Point of Failure
  - Comparisons:
    - Channel Partitioning MAC Protocols
      - Efficient and Fair at High Load
      - Inefficient at Low Load
    - Random access MAC Protocols
      - Efficient at Low Load
      - Inefficient at High Load
    - "Taking Turns" Protocols
      - Best of Both Worlds

  ## Link Layer Addressing

  - ARP: Same LAN
    - ARP Table (exist in Ethernet/LAN nodes)
      - IP Address
      - MAC Address
      - TTL
    - Procedures:
      - A -> B
        - B's MAC Address Not Known
      - A Broadcasts ARP Query
        - Dest MAC address = FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
      - B Receives ARP Query
      - B Unicasts its MAC address to A
      - A Caches MAC Address

## Ethernet

- Topology:
  - Bus topology in 90s
  - Start Topology today
- Ethernet Frame Structure
  - ![Ethernet Frame Structure](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/Ethernet%20Frame%20Structure.png?raw=true)
  - ![Ethernet Frame](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/Ethernet%20Frame.png?raw=true)
  - Preamble: 7 Bytes, used to synchronize
  - Addresses: 6 Bytes
  - Type: Higher Layer Protocal (e.g. IP)
  - CRC: checking bits
- Ethernet CSMA/CD
  - Receives Datagram, Create Frame
  - If Channel Idle
    - Start Frame Transmission
  - Else
    - Wait until Channel Idle, then Transmit
  - If Another Transmission Detected while Transmitting
    - Abort and Send Jam Signal
    - Enter Exponential Backoff
      - After mth collision, choose K at random from {0,1,2,...,2^m-1}
      - Wait K*512 bit times, returns to Step 2
  - Manchester Encoding
    - 10BaseT
    - Each bit has a Transition
      - Synchronisation
      - No Centralised, Global Clock

## Switches and VLANs

- Switch
  - Link-Layer
    - Smarter
    - Store, Forward
    - Selectively Forward
    - CSMA/CD
  - Transparent
  - Plug-and-Play
    - Filtering, Self-Learning Algorithm
- VLANs
  - ![VLANs](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/VLANs.png?raw=true)
  - Port-Based VLANs
    - ![port-based VLANs](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/port-based%20VLANs.png?raw=true)
    - Traffic Isolation
      - Frames to/from ports 1-8 can only reach ports 1-8
    - Dynamic Membership
      - ports can be dynamically assigned among VLANs
    - Forwarding
      - Done via routing (just as with separate switches)

## A Day in the Life of a Web Request

- Scenario (assuming with no cache)
  - Student attaches laptop to campus network
  - Requests/Receives www.google.com
  - ![a day in the life](https://github.com/chopchap/computer-networking/blob/main/images/a%20day%20in%20the%20life.png?raw=true)

- Procedures
  - DHCP
    - Connecting laptop needs to get its own IP address, addr of first-hop router, addr of DNS server by using **DHCP** protocol
    - DHCP request encapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated in 802.1 Ethernet
    - Ethernet frame broadcast (dest: FFFFFFFFFFFF) on LAN, received at router running **DHCP** server
    - Ethernet demux'ed to IP demux'ed, UDP demux'ed to DHCP
    - DHCP server formulates **DHCP ACK** containing client's IP address, IP address of first-hop router for client, name & IP address of DNS server
    - encapsulation at DHCP server, frame forwarded (switch learning) through LAN, demultiplexing at client
    - DHCP client receives DHCP ACK reply
    - _Client now has IP address, knows name & addr of DNS server, IP address of its first-hop router_
  - ARP
    - before sending **HTTP** request, need IP address of www.google.com: DNS
    - DNS query created, enapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated in Eth. In order to send frame to router, need MAC address of router interface: **ARP**
    - **ARP query** broadcast, received by router, which replies with **ARP reply** giving MAC address of router interface
    - _Client now knows MAC address of first hop router, so can now send frame containing DSN query_
  - DNS
    - IP datagram containing DNS query forwarded via LAN switch from client to 1st hop router
    - IP datagram forwarded from campus network into the school's ISP network, routed (tables created by **RIP, OSPF, IS-IS** and/or **BGP** routing protocols) to DNS server
    - demux'ed to DNS server, DNS server replies to client with IP address of www.google.com 
  - TCP
    - to send HTTP request, client first opens **TCP socket** to web server
    - TCP **SYN segment** (step 1 in 3-way handshake) inter-domain routed to web server
    - Web server responds with **TCP SYNACK** (step 2 in 3-way handshake)
    - TCP **connection established!**
  - HTTP
    - **HTTP request** sent into TCP socket
    - IP datagram containing HTTP request routed to www.google.com
    - Web server responds with **HTTP reply** (containing web page)
    - IP datagram containing HTTP reply routed back to client
    - now web page finally displayed
