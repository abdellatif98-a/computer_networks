- 802.11 MAC Protocol: CSMA/CA
  - 802.11 Sender
    - if sense channel idle for DIFS then
      - transmit entire frame (no CD)
    - if sense channel busy then
      - start random backoff time 
      - timer counts down while channel idle
      - transmit when timer expires
      - if no ACK, increase random backoff interval, repeat 2
  - 802.11 Receiver
    - if frame received OK
      - return ACK after SIFS (ACK needed due to hidden terminal problem)
- Avoiding Collisions
  - Idea
    - Allow sender to "reverse" channel
    - Avoid collision of long data frames
  - RTS
    - sender first transmit small request-to-send (RTS) packets to BS using CSMA
    - RTSs may still collide with each other
  - CTS
    - BS broadcasts clear-to-send CTS in response to RTS
  - CTS heard by all nodes
    - sender transmits data frame
    - other stations defer transmissions
